# Password Generator

### Overview

A simple yet powerful password generator built with Python. It allows users to generate strong, random passwords to enhance their online security.

### Getting Started

    git clone https://github.com/nadinejackson1/password-generator.git
    cd password-generator
    python password_generator.py
